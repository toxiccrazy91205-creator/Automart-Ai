## 🤖 Models

### K-Means Customer Segmentation (`models/kmeans_model.py`)

Groups customers into **Low / Medium / High Value** segments based on purchase behaviour.

**Pipeline:** Aggregate by Customer ID → Normalize with `StandardScaler` → Apply `KMeans(n_clusters=3)` → Rank by profit

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `prepare_customer_data(df)` | Aggregates raw rows into one row per customer |
| `scale_features(customer_df)` | Normalises Quantity_Sold and Profit |
| `apply_kmeans(customer_df)` | Runs KMeans and appends Cluster column |
| `segment_customers(df)` | Full pipeline: prepare → scale → cluster |
| `label_clusters(df)` | Adds human-readable Segment column |
| `cluster_summary(df)` | Mean quantity, mean profit, and count per cluster |

---

### Apriori Association Rules (`models/apriori_model.py`)

Answers the question: *"If a customer buys Product A, how likely are they to buy Product B?"*

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Support** | How often an itemset appears across all transactions |
| **Confidence** | How often B is bought given A is bought |
| **Lift** | How much more likely B is when A is present vs. by chance (Lift > 1 = genuine association) |

**Pipeline:** Load `transaction_dataset.csv` → Build basket matrix → Run Apriori (`min_support=0.01`) → Generate rules (`min_lift=1`) → Sort by lift

---

### LSTM Sales Forecasting (`models/lstm_pytorch.py`)

Predicts **next-day total sales quantity** using a recurrent neural network trained on historical daily sales.

**Model Architecture:**
```
Input: [batch, 7 days, 1 feature]
  → LSTM(input_size=1, hidden_size=50, batch_first=True)
  → Linear(50 → 1)
Output: Predicted next-day quantity (single float)
```

**Pipeline:** Aggregate daily sales → Create 7-day sliding window sequences → Train for 10 epochs (MSELoss + Adam) → Predict from last 7 days

---

## 🧠 Agents

Each agent exposes a single `*_agent_summary()` master function used by both the dashboard and CLI. Models are pure ML; agents add the business interpretation on top.

### Customer Agent (`agents/customer_agent.py`)
Segments customers and generates marketing strategies. Uses **Google Gemini** via LangChain if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise falls back to rule-based logic:
- Profit > 500 → Offer loyalty rewards
- Profit < 200 → Provide discounts
- Otherwise → Target with promotions

### Inventory Agent (`agents/inventory_agent.py`)
Tracks product demand, flags low-stock items, calculates restock quantities, and surfaces festival-driven demand spikes.

**Restock Formula:**
```
If Quantity_Sold < 100:  restock = 150 - Quantity_Sold
Else:                    restock = 0   (no action needed)
```

### Profit Agent (`agents/profit_agent.py`)
Analyses profitability at the product level and store level. Identifies top performers and products running at a loss.

### Recommendation Agent (`agents/recommendation_agent.py`)
Uses the Apriori model to surface product bundling and cross-sell opportunities. Reads from `transaction_dataset.csv`.

```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

**Page 1 — Sales & Inventory**
- Sales trend line chart
- One-click LSTM next-day sales prediction
- Top profitable products bar chart

---

## ⚙️ Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supermarket-ai.git
cd supermarket-ai
```

**2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. (Optional) Set your Google Gemini API key for AI-powered insights**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"   # macOS/Linux
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here        # Windows
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the Dashboard (recommended)
```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

### Run the Full Pipeline via CLI
```bash
python main.py
```

The CLI runner executes every pipeline step in order and prints results to the terminal. Each step is wrapped in `try/except` so a single failure won't crash the entire run.

| Step | What Runs | Output |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `preprocess_data()` | Loads and enriches the CSV |
| 2 | `run_lstm(df)` | Trains LSTM, prints predicted next-day sales |
| 3 | `label_clusters(df)` | Prints customer segments and cluster stats |
| 4 | `get_rules()` | Prints top Apriori association rules |
| 5 | `inventory_agent_summary(df)` | Prints demand, low stock, and alerts |
| 6 | `customer_agent_summary(df)` | Prints high-value customers and insights |
| 7 | `profit_agent_summary(df)` | Prints profit totals and loss warnings |
| 8 | `recommendation_agent_summary()` | Prints top product bundle rules |

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

The preprocessing module is called **once** at startup — both `main.py` and `dashboard.py` pass the same enriched DataFrame to every downstream component, avoiding duplicate file reads.

| Component | Depends On | Feeds Into |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `preprocessing.py` | Raw CSV files | All models and agents |
| `kmeans_model.py` | `preprocessing.py` output | `customer_agent.py`, `dashboard.py` |
| `apriori_model.py` | `transaction_dataset.csv` | `recommendation_agent.py`, `dashboard.py` |
| `lstm_pytorch.py` | `preprocessing.py` output | `dashboard.py`, `main.py` |
| `customer_agent.py` | `kmeans_model.py` | `dashboard.py`, `main.py` |
| `inventory_agent.py` | `preprocessing.py` output | `dashboard.py`, `main.py` |
| `profit_agent.py` | `preprocessing.py` output | `dashboard.py`, `main.py` |
| `recommendation_agent.py` | `apriori_model.py` | `dashboard.py`, `main.py` |

---

## 🔧 Configuration

The system works out of the box without any configuration. The only optional setting is:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key for LLM-powered marketing insights in the Customer Agent | Falls back to rule-based insights |

---

## 📦 Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `streamlit` | 1.56.0 | Web dashboard framework |
| `pandas` | 3.0.2 | Data loading, manipulation, and aggregation |
| `numpy` | 2.4.4 | Numerical operations and array handling |
| `torch` | 2.11.0 | LSTM model training and inference |
| `scikit-learn` | 1.8.0 | KMeans clustering and StandardScaler |
| `mlxtend` | 0.24.0 | Apriori algorithm and association rules |
| `langchain-core` | 1.3.2 | Agent framework for LLM-powered insights |
| `matplotlib` | 3.10.9 | Charting support |
| `scipy` | 1.17.1 | Scientific computing (used by mlxtend) |

---

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

- **Single preprocessing call** — `preprocess_data()` runs once; the enriched DataFrame is passed to every component.
- **Agent pattern** — Each agent exposes one `*_summary()` master function, keeping the dashboard and CLI interfaces clean.
- **Graceful AI fallback** — The Customer Agent tries Google Gemini first but always falls back to rule-based insights, so the system works without any API key.
- **Models vs. Agents separation** — Models are pure ML (no business logic). Agents add the business interpretation on top of model outputs.
- **Error isolation** — Every step in `main.py` is wrapped in `try/except` so a single model failure doesn't crash the entire pipeline.
